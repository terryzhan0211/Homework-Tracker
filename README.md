# My Personal Project
This application will create a **TODO-list** project.This project should have these main functions:
- create a todo-list for the users
- have a list of uncompleted tasks
- have a list of completed tasks
- allow users to edit their tasks

Those functions mentioned above may not sufficient to form a good and impressive todo-list project. But I could add
more functions and provide convenience for those **aimed users**: students, teachers and those workers with tight schedule.

As a student in UBC, we often ues the Canvas Dashboard as our tasks reminder. However, sometimes some tasks cannot be 
seen on the Dashboard. We may miss some tasks if we forget to check them in other webpages separately. Therefore,
An individual and efficient todo-list is in great need. ***That is why this project interests me.***

## Phase 4: Task 2

- option chose:Test and design a class in your model package that is robust.  You must have at least one method that 
throws a checked exception.  You must have one test for the case where the exception is expected and another where 
the exception is not expected.
- The classTaskManger and method addTasksToTodolist() have a robust design

the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.
